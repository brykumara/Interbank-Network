# Interbank-Network
This is a submission I made for the individual coursework of COMP0046 Networks and Systemic Risk at UCL during my master's degree from 2021 to 2022.

The task was to create a report of around 2500 words examining an interbank network containing external assets, interbank liabilities, and bank equities. We examined how they reacted to financial shocks and fire sale scenarios. The report was divided into three parts:
1. You should Presented a statistical characterization of the system for what concern the
distributional properties of balance sheets and interbank claims, and described the topological properties (e.g. degree distribution, clustering, assortativity) of the interbank network.
2. Perform a stress test using the Furfine Algorithm.
3. Perform a fire-sale test where parts of the external assets of each node is invested in a common asset and fire sales can devalue shared external assets.

We made our own scenarios for initial exogenous shocks, the recovery rate, and liquidity of external assets for this report. The final grade classification of this report is a distinction.
